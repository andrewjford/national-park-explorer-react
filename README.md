# National Park Explorer

A map based web application for exploring U.S. National Parks.

Demo: https://natl-park-explorer.herokuapp.com/
Back end API: https://github.com/andrewjford/national-park-explorer-api

This is a React app created with create-react-app. It pulls National Park Service data from/through a back end API (see link above).

The main page shows markers on the map for each US National Park. Clicking on markers brings up the popup menu for the park with rating functionality and a zoom and details link. The details link renders a page with details and images of the park.
